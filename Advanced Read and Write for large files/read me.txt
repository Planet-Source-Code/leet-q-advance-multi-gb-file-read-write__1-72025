I made this little project to find a way to read and/or write files that
are multi gigs in size. I tried to use the the "Open.. for.. access.."
that VB6 has and it errors out due to an overflow. You can't even use
the eof() and lof() function VB6 has because they will just error and
overflow. Try it yourself. Try using LOF() to get the length of a file
that is 8 GB's in size, it just will not do it. So I hope this helps
some people out. It's just an example of a use for this. I'm sure those
whose eye this post catches will find many uses for it. Happy Coding.
